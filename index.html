        <p>My passion is developing educational media artifacts. The following are projects that I originally created while in graduate school. They were developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Camtasia Studio and Blogger.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://stu.westga.edu/~kalders1/curriculum_web/home.html" target="_blank">Project #1 Where Did My Money Go? WebQuest</a></h3>
        <p>I created a WebQuest that walks students through the real life tasks of computing payroll taxes and net pay. It starts by walking students through completing the government-required forms used to determine income tax: the Federal W-4 and the Georgia G-4. It also encourages students to start thinking about and researching possible career choices. By the end of the WebQuest, students will have completed the income tax forms, researched the typical take-home pay for their desired careers and created a household budget based on the take-home pay they calculated.</p>
          
        <h3><a href="http://stu.westga.edu/~kalders1/medt7470/andersonville.mp4" target="_blank">Project #2 Andersonville Prison video</a></h3>
        <p>This video was an assignment from my Video Production and Utilization class. I created a short video focused on the Andersonville prison here in Georgia from the Civil War using PowerPoint, Camtasia and Audacity. The assignment was to create a video aligned to a Georgia Performance standard. This video correlates to SS8H6b: "State the importance of key events of the Civil War; include. . .Andersonville."</p>

        <p>However, this project can be used for more than just a review of social studies content. It is an example of how to create a multimedia product without copyright infringement. I created it with the goal of using only public domain images and music that the creator made available for fair use educational purposes.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://socialprofessionaldevelopment.blogspot.com/2012/04/welcome-twitter-for-professional.html" target="_blank">Project #3 Twitter For Professional Development</a></h3>

        <p>This tutorial covers the basics of how to use Twitter as a tool for both personal development and within the classroom. I provided information about how to create a Twitter account, use it responsible and engage in meaningful interactive on this platform. I chose this topic as a result of a discussion in my Distance Education Professional class. A number of my classmates had mentioned that they never used Twitter before and were curious about how it could add value to their professional lives.</p>


        <h2 id="ruby-on-rails">Ruby on Rails</h2>
        <p> Last year, I learned how to build Ruby on Rails applications through the immersion course offered by Tech Talent South. I have been attending RailsBridge, Rails Girls Atlanta, and Women Who Code Atlanta events since then to further develop this new skill.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://suggestotron-kaia.herokuapp.com" target="_blank"> Suggestotron</a></h3>
        <p>This is the web application I created during a coding weekend event. Users can suggest future blog topics and then vote Yay or Nay for the suggestions. I'm still tinkering with it. Future features will include displaying an average score and list the suggestions in order by the average score.</p>
